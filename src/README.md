Modified: 2024-11

## Project Structure

Firmware entry point is `main.c`.

1. `bsp` - contains board support package firmware describing hardware configuration. The code is autogenerated by CubeMX and should never be modified directly.
2. `common` - firmware and config common to all modules
3. `drivers` - custom hardware drivers. Dependant on `bsp`.
4. `os` - firmware modules providing the core application functionality. Dependant on `drivers`.
5. `protocols` - protocol definitions for serialization/deserialization of system telemetry and messages for remote C2.
